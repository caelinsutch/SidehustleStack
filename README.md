# Side Hustle Stack Web

## Getting Started

### Install MongoDB

Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

## Tools
Some commands that enhance the dev experience

```shell

yarn generate # Quickly generate new pages or components
yarn GraphQL # Generate new graphQL types based on `src/GraphQL/schema.GraphQL`

```

### Route Aliases

We've created aliases for common routes, for example, access the `src/Components` directory with `@Components` from anywhere in the app. 

These are configured in `.babelrc` and `tsconfig.json`.
